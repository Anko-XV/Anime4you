    <h2>Shounen</h2>
        <section>

    <p>On this page I explain behind what Shounen is and which shows then might be something for you.
    
        Shōnen manga is a Japanese comic book category for teenage boys. Shōnen manga is one of the main categories of manga, along with shōjo, seinen and josei manga. 
        It is aimed at boys and is usually published in special magazines. Shōnen manga is the most popular category in Japan. 
        Although it seems that it is mainly aimed at young men, people of all ages and genders read it. Shōnen manga originated in Japanese children's magazines in the early 20th century and became popular in the 1920s. 
        It mainly focuses on action, adventure and fighting monsters or evil. Although action stories are the most common , there are many genres within shōnen manga, such as comedy, crime, romance, "slice of life" (everyday life literally translation piece of life) and sports.

        Below I give a few recommendation of shounen anime.

            Together, they encounter  pirates, bounty hunters, criminal organizations, revolutionaries, secret agents, various scientists, soldiers from the morally ambiguous world government along with many other friends and enemies, as they sail the seas in pursuit of their dreams.

            The central tension of the series pits the World Government and its forces against the pirates.  The series frequently emphasizes the moral ambiguity of the "pirate" label, which includes cruel villains, but also all individuals who do not submit to dictatorial rule - and often dream moral lake - of the world government.
            The One Piece world also has supernatural features such as Devil Fruits , which are mysterious fruits that give the power of transformation to anyone who eats them.

            Therefore, traveling between the four seas and the Grand Line is very difficult.</p>
