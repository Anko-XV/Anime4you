            <h2>Seinen</h2>

            
                <p> Seinen (青年, literally "young man") is a genre of manga and anime that primarily focuses on young adult men. Signs often contain one or more of the following content:


                    a complex plot, ranging from slightly surreal or mundane to very depressing 
                     Characters with profound properties (called multi-layered characters) 
                     Emotions are portrayed realistically 
                     The humor is sometimes twofold 
                     sometimes the level of fan service varied 
                     Unlike Shounen, seinen does not emphasize action and adventure, although these can be common elements. The female equivalent of  seinenmanga is joseimanga.</p>

            <a href="https://9animetv.to/watch/vinland-saga-40?ep=1134"><img class="seinen" src="images/Vinland_Saga_volume_01_cover.jpg" alt="blond kid with knife in hand"></a>

                <p > Vinland Saga was set primarily in England in 1013 AD, which was largely conquered by the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard. 
                    When King Sweyn was about to die, his sons, Prince Harald and Prince Canute, fought over the succession.

                    Makoto Yukimura's Vinland Saga manga series features a mix of historical, apocryphal, and fabricated characters in its cast. 
                    The main characters are of Danish origin: Vikings are brought to England to support King Sweyn's invasion of the country.
                    The series is divided into four story arcs focusing on Thorfinn, a young Viking who wishes to kill his superior Askeladd to avenge the death of his father, 
                    Thors. In later seasons, the older Thorfinn questions his guilt and decides to atone for it by finding the land of Vinland, 
                    a place he had been told as a child where people could live in peace. However, Thorfinn struggles to start a new life when he meets people involved in his life as a Viking who share the same interests as the young man.

                <p>
                    Hellsing is named after and centered around the Royal Order of the Protestant Knights originally led by Abraham Van Helsing. 
                    Hellsing's mission  is to find and destroy the undead and other supernatural evil forces  that threaten the queen and  country. 
                    The organization is currently led by Sir Integra Fairbrook Wingates Hellsing, who inherited Hellsing's leadership  as a child after  her father's death. 
                    She witnessed his death, transforming her from an innocent and shy  girl into a harsh and deadly force. She is protected by the  Hellsing family's loyal butler, 
                    Walter C. Dornez,  his own mortal enemy, and Alucard, the original and most powerful vampire, 
                    who swore allegiance to the Hellsing family after being defeated by Van Helsing one hundred years before the story begins. 
                    These formidable guardians are joined at the beginning of the scenario by former police officer Seras Victoria, whom Alucard turned into a vampire.
