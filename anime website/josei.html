        While Josei dramas are in most cases realistic stories about the lives of ordinary women, Romance Josei manga are generally melodramas influenced by television series, while erotic Josei  manga has many similarities with erotic manga aimed at a heterosexual male audience.
        The emergence of manga aimed at adult female audiences as a genre in the 1980s was followed by the rise of gekiga in the 1950s and 1960s, which sought to use manga to tell serious stories. complete. The audience is fixed and matures as well as through the development of this manga genre.
        The genre was stigmatized in the late 1980s when it became associated with pornographic comics, but gained greater artistic legitimacy in the 1980s and 1990s when it shifted to stories focusing on social issues.
